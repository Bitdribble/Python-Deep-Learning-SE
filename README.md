This is the code repository for [Python Deep Learning - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-deep-learning-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=), published by Packt.

**Exploring deep learning techniques and neural network architectures with PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow**

## About the Book
This second edition of Python Deep Learning will get you up to speed with deep learning, deep neural networks, and how to train them with high-performance algorithms and popular Python frameworks. You’ll uncover different neural network architectures, such as convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and capsule networks. You’ll also learn how to solve problems in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition. You'll study generative model approaches such as variational autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images. As you delve into newly evolved areas of reinforcement learning, you’ll gain an understanding of state-of-the-art algorithms that are the main components behind popular games Go, Atari, and Dota.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import torch

torch.manual_seed(1234)

hidden_units = 5

net = torch.nn.Sequential(
 torch.nn.Linear(4, hidden_units),
 torch.nn.ReLU(),
 torch.nn.Linear(hidden_units, 3)
)
```

## Get to Know the Author
**Ivan Vasilev** started working on the first open source Java Deep Learning library with GPU support in 2013. The library was acquired by a German company, where he continued its development. He has also worked as a machine learning engineer and researcher in the area of medical image classification and segmentation with deep neural networks. Since 2017 he has focused on financial machine learning. He is working on a Python open source algorithmic trading library, which provides the infrastructure to experiment with different ML algorithms. The author holds an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence from The University of Sofia, St. Kliment Ohridski.

**Daniel Slater** started programming at age 11, developing mods for the id Software game Quake. His obsession led him to become a developer working in the gaming industry on the hit computer game series Championship Manager. He then moved into finance, working on risk- and high-performance messaging systems. He now is a staff engineer working on big data at Skimlinks to understand online user behavior. He spends his spare time training AI to beat computer games. He talks at tech conferences about deep learning and reinforcement learning; and the name of his blog is Daniel Slater's blog. His work in this field has been cited by Google.

**Gianmario Spacagna** is a senior data scientist at Pirelli, processing sensors and telemetry data for the internet of things (IoT) and connected-vehicle applications. He works closely with tire mechanics, engineers, and business units to analyze and formulate hybrid, physics-driven, and data-driven automotive models. His main expertise is in building ML systems and end-to-end solutions for data products. He holds a master's degree in telematics from the Polytechnic of Turin, as well as one in software engineering of distributed systems from KTH, Stockholm. Prior to Pirelli, he worked in retail and business banking (Barclays), cyber security (Cisco), predictive marketing (AgilOne), and did some occasional freelancing.

**Peter Roelants** holds a master's in computer science with a specialization in AI from KU Leuven. He works on applying deep learning to a variety of problems, such as spectral imaging, speech recognition, text understanding, and document information extraction. He currently works at Onfido as a team leader for the data extraction research team, focusing on data extraction from official documents.
